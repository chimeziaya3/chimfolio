Explanations of the technologies used

I used javascprit to create most of my game. Used a little bit of html being that i created most of it through javascript. javascript methods used were mostly arrays and conditionals. Tried to use class but it wasn't working and it got too confusing along the way.

Approach taken

I decide to think about how i was going to create my game. i thought how i was going to create the ground; how i was going to create the bombs; How i was going to create the Digging Man. Since I wasn't sure about it i decided to use javascript to create everything. I attemped to use class which was part of the requirements but i just could't get it to work the same and it used more lines of codes. arrays were used to create the ground and bombs. It was aso used to spread the bombs all over in random spots and get the man to dig. Conditionals were used to help move the digging man across the screen. I used CSS to give the game some style.

forsome reason i am having troulbe uploading my images for the Wireframes

How-to-use instructions

key "a" = move digger to the left
kay "d" = move digger to the right
key "w" = move digger to the top
key "s" = move digger to the bottom

must get to the Yellow Gold to win, but watch out for the traps underground

Unsolved problems

for some reason i stopped the digger from moving out of the game but then it stopped working.
it has something to do with the responsiveness of changing the screen size. 

I had trouble trying to refactor everything being that some javascript methods are confusing to me. I used what i knew.

For some reason in the bottom it digs too parts of the ground instead of one.
